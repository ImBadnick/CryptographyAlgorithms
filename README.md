# CryptographyAlgorithms
This repo contains a few algorithms wrote in python that are used in CyberSecurity.  
You can use them to understand how some cipher works and to do exercise on bit generators, modular inversion, elliptic curves and more.
You will find algorithms about:
1) DH cipher
2) Elliptic curves
3) Random BitGenerators and numberGenerators
4) Miller&Rabin algorithm for prime numbers
5) One-Time-Pad
6) RSA
7) SuccessiveQuadratures
8) Zero-Knowledge
9) EuclideAlgorithm -> used to find the modular inversion of a number
10) Checker if a number is a generator of a cyclic group
11) Modular inversion calculator (Not EuclideAlgo)  

To use them you just need to have python and install the requirements in the virtualenv
1) Copy the repo
2) Create virtualenv -> "virtualenv my_project"
3) Activate virtualenv -> source my_project/bin/activate
4) Download requirements -> pip install -r requirements.txt

These program are used to study the CyberSecurity and understand how it works, are not optimized and the final version of the ciphers!
